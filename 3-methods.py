### Methods
# Methods are functions built in to objects
# Methods example
# object.method(arg1,arg2,etc...)

# lst = [1,2,3,4,5]
# print(lst)

# append adds elements to the end of a list
# lst = [1,2,3,4,5]
# lst.append(6)
# print(lst)

# lst = [1,2,3,4,5]
# print(lst.append(6))


# count the number of occurrences of an element in a list
lst = [1,2,3,4,5,2,2,2,]
print(lst.count(2))
